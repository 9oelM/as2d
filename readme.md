# Warning

This package has not been tested with `AssemblyScript version 0.7.0`. Please advise that this will
require an entire backwards compatible rewrite to the entire `as2d` package. This will come with
optimizations and a better set of unit tests using the `as-pect` testing suite instead of just making
some changes.

This is expected to be completed by July 7th, 2019. In the meantime, this software requires the use of a
`pre-runtime` AssemblyScript compiler.

# Description

This project brings the utility of the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` prototype into `AssemblyScript` in
a very optimized way.

Please see the wiki for instructions on how to get started!
